# Unity Lobby & Cube Spawner Project

This project is a small-scale demonstration built using the Unity game engine, C#, and TextMeshPro (TMP). Its core functionality revolves around two main scenes: the **Lobby** and the **Room**. In the Lobby, users are prompted to enter their desired player name using an input field. Upon confirmation, this name is saved temporarily via `PlayerPrefs`, and the application transitions to the main Room scene. The Room scene then retrieves the saved name to display a personalized welcome message. Additionally, the Room scene features a basic `CubeSpawner` component that can instantiate new cube game objects at random locations, demonstrating simple in-game object creation.

The project development strictly followed version control requirements using Git. The entire history is tracked across three distinct commits, ensuring a clear and segmented development log. The first commit (`setup`) initialized the repository and included essential configurations like the `.gitignore` file. The second commit (`logic`) introduced the core C# scripts, specifically the `LobbyManager`, `RoomManager`, and `CubeSpawner`, implementing the main functionality. Finally, the third commit (`polish`) covered minor improvements, code cleanup, and adjustments to assets or materials, fulfilling the required stages of development.
